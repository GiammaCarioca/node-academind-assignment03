    <h1>FENTY BLUE</h1>
    <p>The core colour palette of blue and double cream was inspired by the pursuit to find a colour that would stand out, be gender neutral, and have a meaningful connection to Rihanna â€“ the blue of Barbados. Double Cream offers a calmer, more classical colour to sit against garments on labelling and tags.</p>
